"""This script enables automation of the calibration process.

Instead of manually tracking the progress of the abm, and restarting once a
certain file has been written, this script will start transcad, initialize the
abm, run the model, and terminate when a desired output is written. This script
also enables looping, such that any number of calibration iterations can be run
in sequence.
